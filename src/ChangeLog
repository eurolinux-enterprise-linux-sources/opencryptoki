* opencryptoki-2.3.3 (Jan 13 2011)
- Moderate fixes and clean-ups to key unwrapping mechanisms
- several pkcsconf fixes, some minor changes
- Important fix to CCA library name in pkcs11_startup
- PKCS padding length fix for symmetric ciphers
- Better RSA public exponent validations in all supported tokens
- Huge testsuite refactor
- Several other minor fixes and cleanups

* opencryptoki-2.3.2 (Jul 29 2010)
- Significant clean-ups to the building and packaging systems and many
  small fixes by Klaus Heinrich Kiwi <klausk@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
- Various minor fixes to slot daemon and init script by Dan Hor√°k
  <dan@danny.cz>
- Some RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding clean-ups by Ramon de Carvalho Valle
  <rcvalle@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
- Human-readable flags output to pkcsconf, some minor soft-token
  fixes by Kent Yoder <key@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
- Improved overall session/object look-up performance. Note that this
  change might crash buggy callers with badly-written session/object
  handle tracking - Klaus Heinrich Kiwi <klausk@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

* openCryptoki-2.3.1
- Moved ICA token to use libica-2.0, supporting newer hardware and 4K
  RSA modulus. Libica-2.x is now *required* to build the ICA token.
- Moved CCA token to use CCA-4.0, supporting AES, SHA-2 and 4K RSA
  keys in newer hardware. Although not required for building, CCA-4.0
  is *required* for running the CCA token.

* openCryptoki-2.2.5

- Fixed bug in comparison of PINs in pkcsconf.
- Added code to set the encryption and signature schemes of keys imported
into the TPM token.
- Added tpm token message to warn when only owner can read the pub SRK.
- Fixed return code of function failed when it should be buffer too small in
various mech_des.c mech_des3.c and mech_aes.c files.
- Moved doc/*.txt to manpage format and integrated them into the build/install
- Updated testcases to query env vars for PINs and call a set of common
routines for common operations
- Added SHA256 support for all tokens
- Fixed object cleanup when max number of token objects is hit
- Fixed fd exhaustion bug with spin lock fd
- Updated TPM stdll for TSS policy handling changes. Trousers 0.2.9+ now
required with openCryptoki 2.2.5
- Updated TPM stdll to use TSS_TSPATTRIB_KEYINFO_RSA_MODULUS when retrieving
the public modulus
- pkcs11_startup fix for use with s/w fallback support in libica on s390
- Added the CCA secure key token and migration utility
- Replaced bcopy/bzero with memcpy/memset throughout the code
- Removed unused variables throughout the code

* openCryptoki-2.2.4
