TODO:

Proper exit from pkcsslotd.  Catch the signal and gracefully
shutdown.  This should avoid the shared memory failure to
shut down.

Hardware version and firmware versions are currently hard coded
in usr/lib/pkcs11/methods/leeds_slot/pkcs_slot.bash. Query from
card if possible in InitSharedMemory in pkcsslotd/shmem.c.

[2009-10-05] Refactor build system
 * Allow installing to non-standard directories
 * Work /lib & /lib64 confusion with pkcs11_startup
 * Avoid arch-dependant switches
 * Use a more standardized and easily-understandable configure/
   build process
 * Create summary screen for configure screen

[2009-10-05] usr/sbin/pkcs_slot/pkcs_slot.in: Avoid using
`uname -s` for Slot's description and Manufacter, as this
identifier varies widly and doesn't bring any useful information.
Maybe we should use the opencryptoki version instead?

[2009-10-05] Better object-store debugging and tracing.
 * Dump the object every time a PKCS#11 fetches or
   pushes it
 * Create utilities to debug/list/inspect object
   (this can either be per-token, giving more speciallized
   details, or be a generalized one using pkcs#11 calls)

[2009-10-05] Refactor the testcases
 * Detect what mechanisms are available and run only the
   relevant tests
 * As above, detect relevant limits for each mechanisms
   (key size, block size etc) and make tests that
   exercise those limits

[2009-10-05] Give human-readable error messages wherever
possible, including:
 * Tooling (pkcsslotd, pkcsconf et al)
 * Regular log messages and tracing/debug messages

[2009-10-05] Better RPM packaging (our .spec file
should be the template for distro packaging)
 * Split in libopencryptoki and -devel packages
 * Split tokens to have their own (pluggable) packages

[2009-10-05] Help/usage message for pkcsslotd
