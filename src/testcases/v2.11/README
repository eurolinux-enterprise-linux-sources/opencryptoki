The tests in this directory are used to test the new functionality 
added to openCryptoki to comply with v2.11 of the PKCS#11 spec. If
you are pulling this out of CVS, you may be pulling v2.01. If this
is the case, these testcases will fail, and that's to be expected.

aes_func
  * Tests that the AES functions Encrypt/Decrypt and Wrap/Unwrap
    correctly.

rijndael
  * Encrypts using the algorthm used by the Rijndael known answer
    tests and compares with its output.

login
  * Tests the new login functionality used in v2.11.  After running
    this test, you will have to run the init_tok test on the slot
    to unlock the user's account before running other tests.

hw_fn
  * Tests the new hardware feature object class.  This test should
    fail.  It was used to test searching for hardware feature objects,
    which cannot be created by users, but only by tokens.
